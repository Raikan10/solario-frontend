# Solario

Solario is a web3 NFT platform that utilizes NFTs as loans to fund the development of solar farms. The NFTs act as a proof of the loan and staking them will result in a return of 6%.

You can visit the demo [here](https://solario-frontend.vercel.app/)

# How it works
 - We find customers who want to switch to solar
--If they can save money vs. what they currently pay for their (largely coal powered) electricity.
 - We help finance the switch to solar
--Financing helps spread the upfront cost of solar over time. The better the financing terms, the lower the monthly cost. If the monthly cost of solar falls well below what our customers currently pay, they are eager to switch.
- You invest
--Your money adds to the pool of financing for our solar projects. Projects listed here may already be in a portfolio or about to receive an investment. Your loan may fund a new plant, or support an existing funding need which frees up capital for a new plant.
- You earn a return while accelerating clean energy
--We start repaying your loan in monthly installments, 30 days after your investment is finalized. You can instantly withdraw that money or re-deploy it into more solar projects!
